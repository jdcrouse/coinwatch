Application Design




Necessary things (remove later):

[X] 1. Overview - Describe your application
[?] 2. User Stories - Provide several user stories for your application,
                      covering most use cases and all user roles
[X] 3. Data Design - How are you storing your data? Where does it come from?
                     What do you do with it? Provide initial schemas and
                     relationships.
[X] 4. App Interface - What are the major pages of your application? What's on
                       them, and what do users use them for?
[X] 5. Experiments - Describe each of your experiments. What did you learn? Are
                     you going to change anything as a result of the experiment?
[ ] 6. Project Status - How much of the project has been implemented? What
                        works? What problems have your run into so far? Have you
                        made any significant changes to your concept?

Overview

  CoinWatch is a cryptocurrency price-monitoring website. The site connects to
  exchange APIs in order to provide realtime updates on cryptocurrency prices
  across various exchanges. Users can follow select cryptocurrencies in order to
  receive live updates on price changes on their main feed. Users can also sign
  up for email alerts when a currency's value passes a desired amount.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Stories

- As a new user, I can create an account.
- As a returning user, I can log in/log out.
- As a normal user, I can see a listing of all the currencies that are available
  for me to follow.
- As a normal user, I can choose certain currencies to follow/unfollow
- As a normal user, I can sign up for and receive email updates when a currency
  reaches a desired value
- As a normal user, I can change my email address to keep it up to date for
  notifications.
- ...
- ...
- As an admin user, I can remove users, maybe remove available currencies(?)

  ...what else?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Design

  We will keep a database of users and are using the Cryptowatch API to get data
  for various cryptocurrencies. Users provide their own data on registration and
  through interacting with the site after they have registered.

* Users:
  - Fields:
    > email
    > password (hash)
    > the coins they follow (may be represented as a pairing of user and
      currency, similar to how follows were implemented in microblog)

* Coins/Currencies:
  - Fields:
    > value
    > timestamp of their last update
    > name/symbol
    * coins are very likely to change based on how we implement/integrate the
      Cryptowatch API with our data

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
App Interface (What are the major pages of your application? What's on
                them, and what do users use them for?)

  The most important page for users is the main feed, where they will get live(ish)
  updates on the price of the cryptocurrencies they select to watch. There will
  also be an index of all available currencies to allow user to have an idea of
  the rage of currencies offered and be able to check/uncheck a select few. We
  will likely implement some sort of account settings so users can change things
  about their account, especially since we are offering the ability to receive
  email notifications and we want users to be able to keep their email address
  up to date.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Experiments

- Polling
    This experiment was a test to ensure that we can perform an operation
    every x seconds. The experiment was successful, and we are using this to
    update currency values from an API every few seconds to keep users up to
    date on the prices of currencies they want to see.

- API
    This experiment tested to ensure that we can access the data from
    Cryptowatch's API and process it. This one was successful as well, and
    helped to solidify the base on which our cryptocurrency application will
    function. We are using the Cryptowatch API, which allows us to retrieve
    price values from multiple exchanges all from one API to give users multiple
    options when deciding where to get the best value for their money.

- Email
    This experiment was done to figure out how email can be sent through Elixir/
    Phoenix. We were able to find success at this using Mailgun (email service)
    and the corresponding library that is available for use in Phoenix. Using
    Mailgun ended up being more straightforward than expected, and was a good
    intro to using SMTP for email-sending.

- Front-end
    The front-end experiment is a two page application using React. The app
    consists of a landing page and a demo page. The landing page is where the
    user begins, which we can later use to update the user on their personalized
    currency feed or to put any helpful information we might want users to see
    upon visiting the website for the first time or just logging in. The demo
    page currently updates automatically every 5 seconds with mock data to
    illustrate what our application could look like when it is actually fully
    functioning.

Project Status (How much of the project has been implemented? What works?
                    What problems have your run into so far? Have you made any
                    significant changes to your concept?)
